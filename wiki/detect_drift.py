"""detect-drift: Compute drift by comparing each doc's SourceCommitID to HEAD.

For each managed doc that has a SourceCommitID in its footer, runs
`git diff <SourceCommitID>..HEAD -- <path>` in the target repo to find changed
files. Logs one entry per doc that has drift. Idempotent — re-running overwrites
existing entries for the same doc rather than appending duplicates.

Called by the pre-commit hook (--staged computes against staged+HEAD). Safe to
call manually at any time.
