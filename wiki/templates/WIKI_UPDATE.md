# WIKI_UPDATE — Documentation Update Guide

## When to update

Check `.claude-wiki/flags.json` before any doc work.

- `drift_detected` — source files changed since the doc was last reviewed; see `drift.jsonl`
- `new_entry` — a placeholder doc exists with no real content; see `new-entry.jsonl`

Run `.claude-wiki/wiki status` for a summary of which docs are affected and how many files changed under each.

## How to detect drift for a specific doc

Each managed doc has a metadata footer at the bottom:

```
<!-- claude-wiki-meta
Location: src/payments/CLAUDE.md
SourceCommitID: def5678
-->
```

`SourceCommitID` is the target repo commit the doc was last reviewed against. To see exactly what changed since then:

```bash
git diff <SourceCommitID>..HEAD -- <path>/
```

For example:
```bash
git diff def5678..HEAD -- src/payments/
```

The `drift.jsonl` log pre-computes this for you — each entry includes `from_commit`, `to_commit`, and `changed_files` so you can run the diff directly without reading the footer manually.

## How to update a doc

1. **Read the current doc** at the symlink path (e.g. `src/payments/CLAUDE.md`) or at `docs/<path>/CLAUDE.md` in the wiki. They are the same file.

2. **Run the git diff** for this doc's path using the commit range from the footer or `drift.jsonl`. Read the changed files and identify what actually changed.

3. **Ask: does anything in the doc need to change?** See "What to look for" below. If nothing changed that affects the doc — stop here and just clear the flag.

4. **Check the template** at `.claude-wiki/CLAUDE.template.md` — every doc must follow this structure.

5. **Check the house rules** at `.claude-wiki/instructions.md` for project-specific writing conventions.

6. **Edit the doc directly** via the symlink. Changes are immediately live in the wiki. Follow these rules:
   - Write for an LLM agent, not a human reader. Be terse.
   - No padding, no filler. Omit anything self-evident from well-named code.
   - Prefer present tense, active voice, concrete nouns.
   - Document anything novel, proprietary, or non-obvious.
   - Do not duplicate content from ancestor CLAUDE.md files — they own their scope.
   - Do not edit or remove the `<!-- claude-wiki-meta` block at the bottom.

7. **Clear the flag** when all drifted docs are resolved:
   ```
   .claude-wiki/wiki clear-flags --flag drift_detected
   ```
   This stamps `SourceCommitID = HEAD` on every doc that had drift, resetting the baseline. `clear-flags` auto-clears a flag if its backing log is already empty.

## What to look for

When diffing source files against a doc, ask:

- Did the public interface (functions, exports, config keys) change?
- Did any invariants, contracts, or error-handling patterns change?
- Are there new or deleted files the doc's Key Files table should reflect?
- Did a naming convention or pattern change that the doc states?
- Is anything the doc currently says wrong or misleading?

If none of the above apply — the doc is still accurate. No edit needed.

## Full review (ignore diff)

If instructed to do a **full review** — phrases like "ignore diff", "check against all time", "review everything", or "full check" — skip the `SourceCommitID` workflow entirely. Instead:

1. Read all source files currently under the doc's path (scan the directory).
2. Read the current doc in full.
3. Compare holistically: does the doc accurately describe the code as it exists today?
4. Apply the same "what to look for" criteria, but against the entire codebase under that path, not just changed files.

Use this when:
- The doc's baseline is suspect (recently absorbed, never properly reviewed)
- `SourceCommitID` is missing or very old
- The user explicitly requests it

After a full review, clear the flag normally — `clear-flags` will stamp `SourceCommitID = HEAD`.

## Doc placement rules

- A CLAUDE.md covers only code **at or below** its path.
- Place content at the **highest level where it still applies exclusively**.
- Parent docs cover: repo layout, tech stack, global conventions, shared interfaces.
- Sub-docs cover module-specific detail; do not repeat what a parent already states.
